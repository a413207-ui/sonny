// 熾焰火球 / Blazing Fireball
// jelly-survivors：由 tools/build-vfx.mjs 從 00GameDevs 原檔 fireball.js 產生；共用程式在 ../runtime.js。
// Fireball: hit ends after lifecycle.hitEnd (2 visual seconds); stop uses lifecycle.end (0.8).
// 火球命中與一般停止有不同收尾時間；持續 update 至 finished，不以 end 提早釋放命中餘煙。
// Continue update until finished. hit(worldPoint, worldNormal) clips to a supplied valid contact plane; omitted normal keeps an uncut airborne burst.
// Level7: white-hot flash, arcs, sparks, 30 rocks (10-30% mean size; fade at age .35-.65), wall heat. Use fx.render(renderer,scene,camera) instead of renderer.render to include the calibrated glow; call once per scene/frame; it includes glow from all Fireball instances in that scene. This renders the entire scene with an opaque output, SRGBColorSpace and NoToneMapping (ACES/transparent composition not supported). Contact normal only controls the static plane.
